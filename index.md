# CS 499 ePortfolio

### Introduction

I was never really good at coding and had no interest in it while in high school. The funny thing is that my father knows how to do just about everything with a computer. What he has been able to do was self-taught. I have always thought highly of my father for being able to do that for himself and for his family. I was in school for mechanical engineering when I first started. After getting married, having children, and still working full time I found that there was not enough time for school since I had to be on campus for classes. I even had to work two jobs just to make ends meet when my wife was pregnant with both of your children due to health issues that came about. I decided that there needed to be a change, not just for me, but for my family and our future. I needed something flexible to where I could make more money and still be around at home if need be. After researching different careers, I landed on software engineering. I still was not a huge fan of coding, but after seeing what I could accomplish and the dividends that I could secure within the field, it definitely had my head pointed towards it. I talked to my wife about this and what challenges we may face and she was on board with it. Took the first step to register for the field and found out that the curriculum would not be that long and the terms were only 8 weeks, which was very appealing. The fundamental classes leading up to this capstone course were sometimes rigorous, but most of all expanding my viewpoint on computer science as a whole. This also opened me up to the different technology fields such as software architecture, mobile application design, and web development. I really enjoyed the little bit of web development I learned. I furthered that learning through a coding bootcamp on the side to enhance my skills in the field. My goal was to be able to find a great job, but also be able to create my own hustle on the side. I wanted to be able to teach my children about this field and to show them that their father could overcome any challenges. That way they have no excuses when they grow up themselves. I will be the second in my family to even graduate from college. I have been pushed by my own parents, wife, and friends to be this done. Now that I am finally here, I cannot believe it.

### SNHU Computer Science Program

The computer science program at SNHU (Southern New Hampshire University) has shown me a multitude of different career options I had no idea existed. From the very start of the courses that I have taken, I was immersed in a constant flow of information which prompted many creative ideas on projects that I wanted to complete. In this coursework, I have studied many different programming languages centered around Java and C++ in majority. With those languages, I have taken part in many projects over program that have both tested and built upon the skills that a foundation was built upon. Aside from languages, I have learned about many engineering concepts and practices. Design principles, architecture, and security were the most important principles that I grasped to and will forever be a part of me moving forward into my career. In completing this program, I have gained insight into vulnerabilities and pitfalls of coding with the publicâ€™s concerns. Though I did not have many chances to collaborate in a team environment, my work experience has more than eclipsed any teamwork requirements for a professional position. As stated before, getting an education on other career paths within the IT field pushed me into learning outside of the classroom. During this program I took part in a web development bootcamp that taught me about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also learned design principles with web development as well. The culmination of these teachings brought me to the artifacts that I selected for this course.

### Portfolio Summary

The first artifact selected was a static web project that I was asked to complete for a friend. This was one of the first projects that I was asked to complete for an outside party. I wanted to include this to showcase my skills in web development, which I really enjoy. The second artifact selected for this course was a mobile application that I created for a course. Web development gave me the control that I enjoy, but mobile application development was on another level. I used Java in the creation of this application. This application was created to house user login information and event information into two separate databases and then display that information on a separate screen. The user would then be able to update that event information after successfully logging into the application. This project provides an excellent example and takes user stories and requirements to implement them into creating a project. The last artifact that I selected was a bid application coded using C++. This project works by allowing a user to search for a bid. It also will bring results in a sorted order. The application also allows the user to sort by the amount. The application uses a binary search tree to perform the steps to find the bid based upon the amount or the bid id. This last project was selected because I wanted to be versatile in the languages that I have used during my program. C++ to go along with Java, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript makes for a solid foundation for coding different projects that are made in this day. 

# Portfolio Projects

## Ahmaud Arts

A. Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?  

This artifact is an art gallery website. This website was built to both display art available for sale and provide a means of contacting the artist to arrange for payment or to make requests. This project was created about 4 months ago. I have been working on this off and on through course work, but have not been able to complete it fully.  

B. Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?  

I selected this item as it was one of the first projects that I took on by myself with no assistance from an instructor. This is also the first project that I have been asked to complete by a potential client. The components of this artifact that highlight my skills and abilities in software development would be displayed though my coding ability to keep all aspects aligned and easy to read. It also displays my use of common practices within front end development to have all links functional to navigate to the correct locations. This also shows my own creativity in use of a carousel, color selection, and website design for the users. I started improvements with this website by making the navigation bar collapsible and the rest of the page responsive to the size screen a user may be using. I also improved the carousel by making images align.  

C. Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?  

I have not made all adjustments that I was intending on making and will be working on this to finish that by tomorrow. I do not have any other updates that I have wanted to add to this site at this time.  

D. Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face? 

As I was creating the website, it gave me a refresher on class usage. This is one of the most important skills of web development. I also learned more about modals and linking them to actions that I want to take place. It was a challenge finding the right usage of the HTML/CSS language to bring to life what I wanted to happen. I know that there is probably an effortless way to make sure that everything lined up correctly and the navigation bar was the right color that I wanted. I would say that making the navigation bar responsive was one of the most challenging items. I spent the most time on that.

## Event Tracker Application

A. Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?  

This artifact is a mobile application that is used to create an event listing. I created this a few months ago in my mobile architecture and programming course.  

B. Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?  

I included this artifact as it shows my programming skills with Java. This also shows my ability to create databases to store information and to also pull from that information. The databases that hold log in information and event information both work well, but there were absolutely no comments added to this. I first started by adding comments to my work. Secondly, I wanted to go through and see if there were any openings for attack. This portion is still a work in progress at this time.  

C. Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?  

I did not meet all of the enhancements I first planned to accomplish with this artifact. I also feel that display the information is not an enhancement of the database, and security and readability through comments are more important 

D. Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face? 

With this project, unlike the others. Most of the work was already done with this project. The process of going through the project to ensure variable names lead back to the proper objects is a good way to know how the application works. Adding comments into the project for readability gave a refresher on the course on how the functions work. The challenge that I am having now is finding all of the security risks.

## Bid Search Application

A. Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?  

The artifact that I have submitted was supposed to be a website enhancement that I wanted to add, but I thought that it be best that I show a little diversity. This artifact is from my CS260 course, where we created an algorithm that will allow a user to access and manipulate data for bids. This was created in the fall of 2018 if my memory serves me correctly. 

B. Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in algorithms and data structure? How was the artifact improved?  

As stated before, this item was meant to show some diversity. I already have web development using languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This artifact shows my skills with C++. This artifact is also a fitting example of using algorithms and data structures. I first had to make some corrections to this artifact from when I took the course. I further added functions that would allow a user to search by other means for bids other than the id. I also added a feature to be able to sort the data as well. Of course, there were comments inserted along the way with each addition. 

C. Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?  

Since I did not use this artifact in module one there is not anything to go from. This was a better decision than to keep using a single project.  

D. Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face? 

One thing that I learned was the importance of pointers. I had not really picked up these teachings since that course so long ago. It really felt like I was being reintroduced to the material. On top of that, I was better prepared to make enhancements to this work through the other courses that I have taken. I really did not run into any issues after the refresher on the material.
